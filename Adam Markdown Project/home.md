# Pseudocode Standard for Algorithm Description

Pseudocode is a structured approach to describing algorithms using English-like syntax. It allows algorithm designers to focus on the logic of the algorithm without getting bogged down by specific programming language syntax. This standardized pseudocode format aims to provide clarity and consistency in algorithm descriptions.

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to establish a standardized format for writing pseudocode, making it easier for developers and collaborators to understand and implement algorithms across different projects and platforms.

## Constructs Covered
This pseudocode standard covers the following structured programming constructs:
- **Sequence**: Linear progression of tasks performed sequentially.
- **While**: Looping construct with a conditional test at the beginning.
- **If-Then-Else**: Decision-making construct based on Boolean conditions.
- **Repeat-Until**: Looping construct with a conditional test at the end.
- **For**: Specialized loop for iterating a specific number of times.
- **Case**: Multiway branch based on conditions that are mutually exclusive.
- **Nested Constructs**: Embedding one construct within another.
- **Subprocedures**: Invoking modular subroutines for code organization and reusability.
- **Exception Handling**: Handling exceptional conditions within algorithms.
